# Cloud Run

## Create a container and Push to GCR
   See [Containers.md](Containers.md)

## Configuration (Misc)
   Set region: useful (if not set you need to specify it with each command) 
   ```
   gcloud config set run/region us-central1
   ```

## Create a Service
  * Using Console
    * specify the GCR image
    * specify the container port to expose
    * Ingress: allow all traffic
    * Authentication: allow unauthenticated requests
    * Min Number of Instances: 0 (1 for keeping it warm)
    * Access on the URL specified: https://nginx-hello-kk3kws6gka-uc.a.run.app/
    * DNS mapping: you can map one of your verified domains or subdomains
      * DNS mapping provides with a CNAME record which you can add to your name provider
    * Observations
      * based on 'container instance count'  metrics the containers were active only when we accessed the URL which is expected since we set the min number to 0.
      * even after a day the web page was served almost instantly despite no running containers
  * Using gcloud
    * Creating a service
      ```
      gcloud run deploy nginx-hello-world-1 --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/nsx-sandbox/ns-docker-registry/nginx-hello:latest --min-instances=0 --max-instances=2 --port 80 --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
      ```

      Interactive command prompt
      ```
      gcloud run deploy --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/nsx-sandbox/ns-docker-registry/nginx-hello:latest --max-instances=2
      
      Service name (nginx-hello):  nginx-hello-tmp
      Please specify a region:
       [1] asia-east1
       [23] us-central1
      Please enter your numeric choice:  23

      To make this the default region, run `gcloud config set run/region us-central1`.

      Allow unauthenticated invocations to [nginx-hello-tmp] (y/N)?  y

      Deploying container to Cloud Run service [nginx-hello-tmp] in project [nsx-sandbox] region [us-central1]
      ```    
    * creating a service using manifest yaml file
      See [Copying a service](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/managing/services#copy): typically using the exported yaml and renaming the service name is not sufficient and may give errors
      * create a yaml file
        ```

      * Allowing unauthenticated access: By default, the above will give the following error: Error: Forbidden Your client does not have permission to get URL / from this server, when accessed using it's URL.
        To allow unauthenticated invocations, add "allUsers" as a principal and assign it the "Cloud Run invoker" role. See [Allowing public (unauthenticated) access](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/public#command-line)

  * Notes
    * the service urls are https by default (http gets redirect to https). See [Invoking with an HTTPS Request](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/https-request)
    * It may take several minutes to create a service if it's failing (see timeout value). (typical issue could be incorrect container port in service which assumes it to be 8080 by default)
